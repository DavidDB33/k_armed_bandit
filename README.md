# multi-armed_bandits
An experiment with the multi-armed bandits problem applying Reinforcement Learning techniques.

## Description
This problem is a commonly problem used to play with it with reinforcement learning techniques.
The problem consist in that you have one or many bandit machines with arms. Is analogous if you have X machines with an arm each one or one machine with X arms.
In this problem, you can pull an arm and you will got a reward. Every arm give you a reward that follows any kind of distribution and you algorithm has to get the best cumulative reward.

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) for more details.

Here, you can execute the main file and study what this does, modify it or what do you want.

I will improve the code over time. This is the first version.
